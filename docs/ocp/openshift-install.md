# Kagenti Installation on OpenShift

**This document is work in progress**

## Current limitations 

These limitations will be addressed in successive PRs.

- UI Auth and token management is disabled
- Only [quay.io](https://quay.io) registry has been tested in build from source
- Istio Ambient and network observability has not been tested and is not enabled by default
- URLs for Kiali, Phoenix and Keycloak are not working in UI
- Ollama models not tested - OpenAI key required for now
- MCP inspector integration in tools details page is not enabled yet
- MCP Gateway integration has not been tested yet

## Requirements 

- helm >= v3.18.0
- kubectl >= v1.32.1 or oc >= 4.16.0
- git >= 2.48.0
- Access to OpenShift cluster with admin authority (We tested with OpenShift 4.18.21)

## Installing the Helm Chart

To start, ensure your `kubectl` or `oc` is configured to point to your OpenShift cluster. You might want to modify `charts/kagenti/values.yaml` to specify the namespaces where agents and tools should be deployed under `agentNamespaces:` and toggle components for installation under `components:`.

### Installing OCI Chart Release Package

1. **Determine Latest Version:**
   - Identify the [latest tagged version](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti/pkgs/container/kagenti%2Fkagenti/versions) of the chart.
   - Set this version in the `LATEST_TAG` environment variable.

2. **Prepare Secrets:**
   - Copy the [.secrets_template.yaml](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti/blob/main/charts/kagenti/.secrets_template.yaml) to a local `.secrets.yaml` file.
   - Edit the `.secrets.yaml` to provide the necessary keys as per the comments within the file.

3. **Kagenti Dependencies Helm Chart Installation:**
   This chart includes all the OpenShift software components required by Kagenti.
   ```shell
   # For example, if the latest tag is 0.1.0-alpha.3
   LATEST_TAG=0.1.0-alpha.3
   helm install --create-namespace -n kagenti-system kagenti-deps oci://ghcr.io/kagenti/kagenti/kagenti-deps --version $LATEST_TAG
   ```
4.  **Kagenti Helm Chart Installation:**
   This chart includes Kagenti software components and configurations.
   ```shell
   helm upgrade --install --create-namespace -n kagenti-system -f .secrets.yaml kagenti oci://ghcr.io/kagenti/kagenti/kagenti --version $LATEST_TAG
   ```

### Installing from Repo

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti.git
   cd kagenti
   ```

2. **Prepare Helm Secrets:**
   - Copy and edit the secrets template:
     ```shell
     cp charts/kagenti/.secrets_template.yaml charts/kagenti/.secrets.yaml
     ```
   - Ensure the required keys are filled as per the comments in the file.

3. **Update Helm Charts dependencies:**

   These commands need to be run only the first time you clone 
   the repository or when there are updates to the charts.

   ```shell
   helm dependency update ./charts/kagenti-deps/
   helm dependency update ./charts/kagenti/
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```shell
   helm install kagenti-deps ./charts/kagenti-deps/ -n kagenti-system --create-namespace 
   ```

5. **Install the Kagenti Chart:**
   ```shell
   helm upgrade --install kagenti ./charts/kagenti/ -n kagenti-system --create-namespace -f ./charts/kagenti/.secrets.yaml
   ```

## Access the UI

After the chart installs, you may access the UI following the instructions in the notes; the URL to UI can be found 
running this command:

```shell
echo https://$(kubectl get route kagenti-ui -n kagenti-system -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')
```

## Running the demo

At this time, only the OpenAI API-backed agents have been tested (`a2a-content-extractor` and `a2a-currency-converter`).
You may use the pre-built images available at https://github.com/orgs/kagenti/packages?repo_name=agent-examples
or build from source. Building from source has been tested only with `quay.io`, and requires setting up a robot account on [quay.io](https://quay.io), creating empty repos in your organization for the repos to build (e.g.`a2a-contact-extractor` and `a2a-currency-converter`) and granting the robot account write access to those repos.

Finally, you may get the Kubernetes secret from the robot account you created, and apply the secret to the namespaces
you enabled for agents and tools (e.g. `team1` and `team2`). 

You should now be able to use the UI to:

- Import an agent
- List the agent
- Interact with the agent from the agent details page
- Import a MCP tool 
- List the tool 
- Interact with the tool from the tool details page


# ðŸš€ Running the Demo

> **Note**
> At this time, only the OpenAI API-backed agents have been tested: `a2a-content-extractor` and `a2a-currency-converter`.

There are two ways to get the agent images for the demo: using pre-built images (recommended for a quick start) or building them from source.

---

## Option 1: Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to get started. The required images are already built and hosted on the GitHub Container Registry.

1.  You can find all the necessary images here: **[kagenti/agent-examples Packages](https://github.com/orgs/kagenti/packages?repo_name=agent-examples)**
2.  No image building or secret configuration is required. You can proceed directly to the **"Verifying in the UI"** section.

---

## Option 2: Build from Source

Follow this path if you want to build the agent container images yourself.

### Prerequisites

* A user or organization account on **[quay.io](https://quay.io)**.
* Namespaces created in your Kubernetes cluster where you will run agents and tools (e.g., `team1` and `team2`).

### Steps

1.  **Configure Quay.io**
    * [Create a robot account](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_quay/3/html/user_guide/managing_robot_accounts) for your organization.
    * Create empty repositories for the images you need to build (e.g., `a2a-content-extractor` and `a2a-currency-converter`).
    * Grant your robot account **write access** to these new repositories.

2.  **Create Kubernetes Image Pull Secret**
    * Navigate to your robot account settings in the Quay.io UI.
    * Select the **Kubernetes Secret** tab and copy the generated secret manifest.
    * Apply the secret to each namespace where agents will run.
      ```bash
      # Save the secret to a file named quay-secret.yaml, then run:
      kubectl apply -f quay-secret.yaml -n team1
      kubectl apply -f quay-secret.yaml -n team2
      ```

3.  **Build and Push the Images**
    * Follow the project's build instructions to build the agent images and push them to your Quay.io repositories.

---

## âœ… Verifying in the UI

After completing either of the setup options above, you should be able to use the UI to:

* **Agents**
    1.  Import a new agent.
    2.  List the imported agent.
    3.  Interact with the agent from its details page.
* **Tools**
    1.  Import a new MCP tool.
    2.  List the imported tool.
    3.  Interact with the tool from its details page.

## Accessing Keycloak

You may access Keycloak from the Admin page. The initial credentials for Keycloak can be found
running the command:

```shell
kubectl get secret keycloak-initial-admin -n keycloak -o go-template='Username: {{.data.username | base64decode}}  password: {{.data.password | base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
```
